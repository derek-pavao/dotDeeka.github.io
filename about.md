About Me

My name is Derek Pavao. I'm a UI Engineer / Front-End Developer living in
Rhode Island. I have been building Web Applications since eary 2012 and have
a passion for new technology.

In 2012 I had the opportunity to move from building web sites to an engineering
department starting a brand new web application. When I joined the department
the tech stack for the new application hadn't even been decided yet. The only
decision that had really been made was that the UI and Backend would be completely
decoupled. The backend would be a Java based application with a REST interface,
and the UI would be a JavaScript based web client.

The decisions of what tools to use were still up to the development team. On the
UI we decided to go with a Single Page Application design. BackboneJS, UnderscoreJS, and
jQuery for the heavy lifting, Handlebars for client side templating, RequireJS for
resolving dependencies, Jasmine for unit testing, and GruntJS to manage our development
workflow and build process.

Working with this newish tech stack I found that I really enjoy learning new technologies.
I spent my spare time bouncing from framework to framework and language to language.
I spent some time with CanJS(JavaScript), Ember(JavaScript),
AngularJS(JavaScript), Express(NodeJS), ActionHero(NodeJS), Sails.js(NodeJS),
loopback.io(NodeJS), Sinatra(Ruby), Flask(Python), and Dart to just name a few.

After all this playing with different tech stacks I had decided that my
stack of choice was loopback.io, a NodeJS framework based on Express, for the backend
and AngularJS, a client side MV* framework, for the frontend. The only problem was
I was using Backbone at work :(. I pitched the idea of switching from Backbone to
Angular to my co-workers and un-surprisingly they were sold on the idea. We re-wrote the
entire application in Angular in just a few weeks.

Since rewriting that application in Angular I have been thoroughly convinced that
Angular is the correct choice for client side development, atleast currently. Its relativley
easy to pickup, quick to make changes and refactor code, and it has a good separation of concerns.
It is also developed by the almighty Google, is under extremely active development, and
is trying to make good use of new apis available in the browser and JavaScript engines, things
like Object.observe to detect changes in objects.

Just incase you can't tell, I'm very much a fan of Angular. But, with the way the
JavaScript landscape changes so rapidly I wouldn't be surprised if in six months I'm
revising this About Me section priasing some other technology :)
